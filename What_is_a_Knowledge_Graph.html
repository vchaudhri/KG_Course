<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>Knowledge graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for
organizing world's structured knowledge over the internet, and a way
to integrate information extracted from multiple data
sources. Knowledge graphs have also started to play a central role in
machine learning as a method to incorporate world knowledge, as a
target knowledge representation for extracted knowledge, and for
explaining what is learned.</p>

<p>Our goal here is to explain the basic terminology, concepts and
usage of knowledge graphs in a simple to understand manner. We do not
intend to give here an exhaustive survey of the past and current work
on the topic of knowledge graphs.</p>

<p>We will begin by defining knowledge graphs, some applications that
  have contributed to the recent surge in the popularity of knowledge
  graphs, and then use of knowledge graphs in machine learning.  We
  will conclude this chapter by summarizing what is new and different
  about the recent use of knowledge graphs. </p>

<h1>2. Knowledge Graph Definition</h1>

<p>A knowledge graph is a directed labeled graph in which the labels
  have well-defined meanings. A directed labeled graph consists of
  nodes, edges, and labels.  Anything can act as a node, for example,
  people, company, computer, etc. An edge connects a pair of nodes and
  captures the relationship of interest between them, for example,
  friendship relationship between two people, customer relationship
  between a company and person, or a network connection between two
  computers.  The labels capture the meaning of the relationship, for
  example, the friendship relationship between two people. </p>

<p>More formally, given a set of nodes <i>N</i>, and a set of
labels <i>L</i>, a knowledge graph is a subset of the cross
  product <i>N &times; L &times; N</i>.  Each member of this set is
  referred to as a triple, and can be visualized as shown below. </p>

<center><img src='images/triple.jpg' height='140'/></center>

<p>The directed graph representation is used in a variety of ways
  depending on the needs of an application. A directed graphs such as
  the one in which the nodes are people, and the edges capture
  friendship relationship is also known as a data graph. A directed
  graph in which the nodes are classes of objects (e.g., Book,
  Textbook, etc.), and the edges capture the <i>subclass</i>
  relationship, is also known as a taxonomy.  In some data
  models, <i>A</i> is referred to as <i>subject</i>, <i>B</i> is
  referred to as <i>predicate</i>, and <i>C</i> is referred to as
  object.
</p>


<p>Many interesting computations over graphs can be reduced to
  navigation. For example, in a friendship knowledge graph,
  to calculate the friends of a friends of a person <i>A</i>, we can
  navigate the knowledge graph from <i>A</i> to all nodes <i>B</i>
  connected to it by a relation labeled as friend, and then
  recursively to all nodes <i>C</i> connected by the friend relation to
  each <i>B</i>.
  
<p>A <b><em>path</b></em> in a graph <i>G</i> is a series of nodes
(v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>,..., v<sub>n</sub>) where for any i
&isin; N with 1 &le; i < n, there is an edge from v<sub>i</sub> to
v<sub>i+1</sub>.  A <b><em>simple path</em></b> is a path with no
repeated nodes. A <b><em>cycle</em></b> is a path in which the first
and the last nodes are the same. Usually, we are interested in only
those paths in which the edge label is the same for every pair of
nodes. It is possible to define numerous additional properties over
the graphs (e.g., connected components, strongly connected
components), and provide different ways to traverse the graphs (e.g.,
shortest path, Hamiltonian path, etc.).  </p>



<h1>3. Recent Applications of Knowledge Graphs</h1>

There are numerous applications of knowledge graphs both in research
and industry.  Within computer science, there are many uses of a
directed graph representation, for example, data flow graphs, binary
decision diagrams, state charts, etc.  For our discussion here, we
have chosen to focus on two concrete applications that have led to
recent surge in popularity of knowledge graphs: organizing information
over internet and data integration.

<h2>3.1 Knowledge Graphs for organizing Knowledge over the Internet</h2>

<p>We will explain the use of a knowledge graph over the web by taking
the concrete example of Wikidata. Wikidata acts as the central storage
for the structured data for Wikipedia. To show the interplay between
the two, and to motivate the use of Wikidata knowledge graph, consider
the city of Winterthur in Switzerland which has a page in
Wikipedia. The Wikipedia page for Winterthur lists its twin towns: two
 are in Switerzland, one in Czech Republic, and one in
Austria.  The city of Ontario in California that has a Wikipedia page
titled <i>Ontario, California</i>, lists Winterthur as its sister
city.  The sister city and twin city relationships are identical as
well as reciprocal. Thus, if a city A is a sister city of another city
B, then B must be a sister city of A. This inference should be
automatic, but because this information is stated in English in
Wikipedia, it is not easy to detect this discrepancy.  In contrast, in
the Wikidata representation of Winterthur, there is a relationship
called <i>twinned administrative body</i> that lists the city of
Ontario. As this relationship is symmetric, the Wikidata page for the
city of Ontario automatically includes Winterthur. Thus, when Wikidata
knowledge graph will be fully integrated into Wikipedia, such
discrepancies will naturally disappear.</p>

<p>
Wikidata includes data from several independent providers, for
  example, the Library of Congress that publishes data containing
  information about Winterthur. By using the Wikidata identifier for
  Winterthur, the information released by Library of Congress can be
  easily linked with information available from other sources.
  Wikidata makes it easy to establish such links by publishing the
definitions of relationships used in it in <i>Schema.Org</i>.</p>

<p>The vocabulary of relations in <i>Schema.Org</i> gives us, at
  least, three advantages. First, it is possible to write queries that
  span across multiple datasets that would not have been possible
  otherwise. One example of such a query is: Display on a map the
  birth cities of people who died in Winterthour?  Second, with such a
  query capability, it is possible to easily generate structured
  information boxes within Wikipedia. Third, structured information
  returned by queries also can appear in the search results which is
  now a standard feature for the leading search engines.
</p>

<p>A recent version of Wikidata had over 80 million objects, with over
  one billion relationships among those objects.  Wikidata makes
  connections across over 4872 different catalogs in 414 different
  languages published by independent data providers. As per the recent
  estimate, 31% of the websites, and over 12 million data providers
  publish Schema.Org annotations are currently using the vocabulary of
  <i>Schema.Org</i>.
</p>

<p>Let us observe several key features of the Wikidata knowledge
  graph. First, it is a graph of unprecedented scale, and is the
  largest knowledge graph available today. Second, it is being jointly
  created by a community of contributors.  Third, some of the data in
  Wikidata may come from automatically extracted information, but it
  must be easily understood and verified as per the Wikidata
  editorial policies. Fourth, there is an explicit effort to provide
  semantic definitions of different relation names through the
  vocabulary in <i>Schema.Org</i>.  Finally, the primary driving use
  case for Wikidata is to improve the web search. Even though Wikidata
  has several applications using it for analytical and visualization
  tasks, but its use over the web continues to be the most compelling
  and easily understood application.
</p>


<h2>3.2 Knowledge Graphs for Data Integration in Enterprises</h2>

<p>Data integration is the process of combining data from different
sources, and providing the user with a unified view of data.  A large
fraction of data in the enterprises resides in the relational
databases.  One approach to data integration relies on a global schema
that captures the interrelationships between the data items
represented across these databases.  Creating a global schema is an
extremely difficult process because there are many tables
and attributes; the experts who created these databases are usually
not available; and because of lack of documentation, it is difficult
to understand the meaning of the data. Because of the challenges in
creating a global schema, it is convenient to sidestep this issue, and
convert the relational data into a database with the generic schema of
triples, ie, a knowledge graph. The mappings between the attributes
are created on as needed basis, for example, in response to addressing
specific business questions, and can themselves be represented within
a knowledge graph.  We illustrate this process using a concrete
example.
</p>

<p>Many financial institutions are interested in creating a company
  knowledge graph that combines the internal customer data with the
  data licensed from third parties.  Some examples of such third party
  datasets include Dunn & Bradstreet, S&amp;P 500, etc. An example usage
  of a company knowledge graph is to assess the risk while making loan
  decisions. The external data contain information such as the
  suppliers of a company. If a company is going through financial
  difficulty, it increases the risk of awarding loan to the suppliers
  of that company.  To combine this external data with the internal
  data, one has to relate the external schemas with the internal
  company schema. Furthermore, the company names used in the external
  sources have to be related to the corresponding customer identifiers
  used by the financial institutions.  While using a knowledge graph
  approach to data integration, determining such relationships can be
  delayed until they are actually required.</p>
  
<h1>4. Knowledge Graphs in Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<p>Knowledge graphs, known as semantic networks, have been used as a
  representation for Artificial Intelligence since the early days of
  the field.  Over the years, semantic networks were evolved into
  different representations such as conceptual graphs, description
  logics, and rule languages. To capture uncertain knowledge,
  probabilistic graphical models were invented.</p>

<p> A widely known application of the representation
  languages that originated from semantic networks is in capturing ontologies. An ontology is formal
  specification of the conceptualization of a domain. An ontology
  plays important role in information exchange and in capturing the
  background knowledge of a domain that could be used for reasoning
  and answering questions.</p>

<p> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standardized a family of knowledge
  representation languages that are now widely used for capturing
  knowledge on the internet.  We will consider one such language known
  as the Resource Description Frame (RDF) in the next chapter. This
  family of languages also includes the Web Ontology Language (OWL),
  and the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). </p>

<p>Orthogonal to the representation of knowledge, a central challenge
  in AI is knowledge acquisition bottleneck, ie, how to capture 
  knowledge into the chosen representation in an economically scalable
  manner. Early approaches relied on knowledge engineering. Efforts
  to automate portions of knowledge engineering led to techniques such
  as inductive learning, and the current generation of machine
  learning.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is natural that the knowledge graphs are being used
as a representation of choice for storing the knowledge automatically
learned. There is also an increasing interest to leverage domain
knowledge that is expressed in knowledge graphs to improve machine
learning.</p>

<h2>4.1 Knowledge Graphs as the output of Machine Learning</h2>

<p>We will consider how graphs are being used as a target output representation for
natural language processing and computer vision algorithms.</p>

<p>Entity extraction and relation extraction from text are two
  fundamental tasks in natural language processing.  The extracted
  information from multiple portions of the text needs be correlated,
  and knowledge graphs provide a natural medium to accomplish such a goal.  For
  example, from the sentence shown on the left, we can extract the
  entities <i>Albert Einstein</i>, <i>Germany</i>, <i>Theoretical Physicist</i>, and
  <i>Theory of Relativity</i>; and the relations <i>born in</i>, <i>occupation</i> and
  <i>developed</i>. Once this snippet of the knowledge graph is incorporated
  into a larger knowledge graph, we get additional links (shown by dotted edges)
  such as a Theoretical Physicist is a <i>kind of</i> Physicist
  who <i>practices</i> Physics, and that Theory of Relativity is
  a <i>branch of </i> Physics.</p>

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align='center'>
  <table>
    <tr><td><b>Albert Einstein</b> was a <b>German-born</b> <b>theoretical
physicist</b> who developed the <b>theory of relativity</b>.
    </td><td><img src='images/nlp_v2.jpg' height='200'/></td></tr>
 </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td></td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>A holy grail of computer vision is the complete understanding of an
image, that is, creating a model that can name and detect
objects, describe their attributes, and recognize their
relationships. Understanding scenes would enable important
applications such as image search, question answering, and robotic
interactions. Much progress has been made in recent years towards this
goal, including image classification and object detection.</p>

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align='center'>
  <table>
    <tr><td><img src='images/vision.jpg' height='200'/></td></tr>
 </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td></td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>For example, from the image shown above, an image understanding
system should produce a knowledge graph shown to the right. The nodes in the
knowledge graph are the outputs of an object detector.  Current research in
computer vision focuses on developing techniques that can correctly
infer the relationships between the objects, such as,
man <i>holding</i> a bucket, and horse <i>feeding</i> from the bucket,
etc. The knowledge graph shown to the right is an example of a knowledge graph.


<h2>4.2 Knowledge Graphs as input to Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Popular deep machine learning models rely on a numerical input
which requires that any symbolic or discrete structures should first
be converted into a numerical representation. <em>Embeddings</em> that
transform a symbolic input into a vector of numbers have emerged as a
representation of choice for input to machine learning models.  We
will explain this concept and its relationship to knowledge graphs
by taking the example of <em>word embeddings</em> and
<em>graph embeddings</em>.</p>

<p> <em>Word embeddings</em> were developed for calculating similarity
  between words. To understand the word embeddings, we consider the
  following set of sentences.</p>

<center>
<table>
    <tr><td>I like knowledge graphs.<td></tr>
    <tr><td>I like databases.<td></tr>
    <tr><td>I enjoy running.<td></tr>
 </table>
</center>

<p>In the above set of sentences, we will count how often a word appears
next to another word, and record the counts in a matrix shown
below. For example, the word <i>I</i> appears next to the
word <i>like</i> twice, and next to word <i>enjoy</i> once, and
therefore, its counts for these two words are 2 and 1 respectively,
  and 0 for every other word.  We can calculate the counts for other
  words in a similar manner to fill out the table.
</p>

<center>
        <table>
	  <tr><td width='60' align='center'>counts</td><td width='60' align='center'>I</td><td width='60' align='center'>like</td><td width='60' align='center'>enjoy</td><td width='60' align='center'>knowledge</td><td width='60' align='center'>graphs</td><td width='60' align='center'>databases</td><td width='60' align='center'>running</td><td width='60' align='center'>.</td></tr>

</table>
</center>

<p>Above table constitutes a matrix which is often referred to
as <em>word cooccurrence</em> counts.  We say that the meaning of each
word is captured by the vector in the row corresponding to that
word. To calculate similarity between words, we can simply calculate
the similarity between the vectors corresponding to them. In practice,
we are interested in text that may contain millions of words, and a
more compact representation is desired. As the above matrix is sparse,
we can use techniques from Linear Algebra (e.g., singular value
decomposition) to reduce its dimensions.  The resulting vector
corresponding to a word is known as <em>word embedding</em>. Typical
word embeddings in use today rely on vectors of length 200. There are
numerous variations and extensions of the basic idea presented
here. Techniques exist for automatically learning word embeddings for
any given text. </p>

<p>Use of word embeddings has been found to improve the performance of
many natural language processing tasks including entity extraction,
relation extraction, parsing, passage retrieval, etc. One of the most
common applications of word embeddings is in auto completion of search
queries. Word embeddings give us a straightforward way to predict
the words that are likely to follow the partial query that a user has
already typed.</p>


<p>As a text is a sequence of words, and word embeddings calculate
  co-occurrences of words in it, we can view the text as a knowledge
  graph in which every word is a node, and there is a directed edge
  between each word and another word that immediately follows it.
  Graph embeddings generalize this notion for general network
  structure. The goal and approach, however, remains the same:
  represent each node in a knowledge graph by a vector, so that the similarity
  between the nodes can be calculated as a difference between their
  corresponding vectors. The vectors for each node are also referred
  to as graph embeddings.</p>

<p>To calculate knowledge graph embeddings, we define a method for
  encoding each node in the graph into a vector, a function to
  calculate similarity between the nodes, and then optimize the
  encoding function. Encoding of a node into a vector is also known as
  a <i>node embedding</i>. One possible encoding function is to use
   <em>random walks</em> of the knowledge graph (typically 32 to 64
  such random walks) and calculate co-occurrence counts of nodes on
  the knowledge graph yielding a matrix similar to co-occurrence
  counts of words in text. There are numerous variations of this basic
  method to calculate knowledge graph embeddings. Just like we have
  encoded a node into a vector, we can also encode the whole graph
  into a vector which is known as graph embedding. There are many
  approaches to calcuate graph embeddings, but perhaps, the simplest
  approach is to add the vectors for each of nodes in the graph and
   obtain a vector representing the whole graph.</p>

<p>We have chosen to explain graph embeddings by first explaining word
embeddings because as it is easy to understand them, and their use is
common place.  Graph embeddings are a generalization of the word
embeddings. They are a way to input domain knowledge expressed in a
  knowledge graph into a machine learning algorithm.  Graph embeddings
do not induce a knowledge representation, but are a way to turn
symbolic representation into a numeric representation for consumption
  by a machine learning algorithm.</p>

<p>Once we have calculated knowledge graph embeddings, they can be used for a
  variety of applications. One obvious use for the knowledge graph embeddings
  calculated from a friendship graph is to recommend new friends. A more
  advanced task involves link prediction (ie, the likelihood of a link
  between two nodes). Link prediction in a company graph could be
  used to identify potential new customers.</p>



<h1>5. Summary</h1>

<p>Graphs are a fundamental construct in discrete mathematics, and
have applications in all areas of computer science. Most notable uses
of graphs in knowledge representation and databases have taken the
form of data graphs, taxonomies and ontologies. Traditionally, such
applications have been driven by a top down design.  As a knowledge
graph is a directed labeled graphs, we are able to leverage theory,
algorithms and implementations from more general graph-based systems
in computer science.
</p>

<p>Recent surge in the use of knowledge graphs is driven because of
the confluence of three different advances: data linking and sharing
over the web graph computations over data, and progress in in NLP and
vision to extract relations from texts and images. A common thread
across all three of these advances is scale.  The knowledge graphs
that are available today are of unprecedented scale. We have already
noted that a recent version of Wikidata had over 80 million objects,
and over 1 Billion relationships. Several industry knowledge graphs
are even bigger, for example, a recent version of the Google knowledge
graph had over 570 million entities, and over 18 Billion
relationships.  This large scale of knowledge graphs makes the
efficiency and scalability of the graph algorithms paramount.</p>

<p>For organizing information on the web, and in many data integration
applications, it is extremely difficult to come up with a top down
design of a schema. The machine learning applications are driven by
the availability of the data, and what can be usefully inferred from
it. Bottom up uses of knowledge graphs do not diminish the value of a
top down design of the schema or an ontology. Indeed, the Wikidata
project leverages ontologies for ensuring data quality, and most
enterprise data integration projects advocate defining the schema on
as needed basis.  Machine learning applications also benefit
significantly with the use of rich ontology for making inferences from
the information that is learned even though a global ontology or a
schema is not required at the outset.</p>

<p>Word-embeddings and graph-embeddings both leverage a graph
  structure in the input data, but they are necessarily more general
  than <em>knowledge graphs</em> in that there is no implicit or
  explicit need for a schema or an ontology.  For example, graph
  embeddings can be used over the network defined by exchange of
  messages between nodes on the internet, and then used in machine
  learning algorithms to predict rogue nodes.  In contrast, for the
  Wikidata knowledge graph, knowledge graphs in the enterprises, and
  in the output representation of machine learning algorithms, a
  schema or ontology can play a central role.</p>

<p>We conclude by observing that the recent surge in interest in
  knowledge graphs is primarily driven by the bottom up requirements
  of several compelling business applications. Knowledge graphs in
  these applications can certainly benefit from the classical work on
  the top down representation design techniques, and in fact, we
  envision that eventually the two will converge.   </p>
